Self-Publishing Axis is my final project for Promineo Tech's Front-End Software
Development bootcamp.

It is a three "page" single-page application. It was built with React, React
Router, and MUI/Material UI.

On the Home page, I utilized MUI's Masonry component to create clickable
elements that contain pictures and text and link to the page of each company.

On the Resources page, I used an API I populated on crudcrud.com to map out
individual cards with the array.map method. The cards are sorted whenever they
are refreshed so they are always in alphabetical order. A form at the bottom
allows users to create new resources, and buttons at the bottom of each card
allow users to either update each resource or delete it. So, this page has full
CRUD functionality.

The last page is a checklist with clickable check boxes that users can check and
uncheck.

Finally, each page has a sticky footer and a responsive nav bar.

Thanks for checking it out.
